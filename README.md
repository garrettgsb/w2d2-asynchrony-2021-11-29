## Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming

There are basically three core learning outcomes today, and with any luck, a bunch of interesting bonus stuff.

### Core Learning Outcomes

* Callbacks - What are those again?
* How's `setTimeout` work?
* How's `setInterval` work?

### Bonus Learning Outcomes

* What's the difference between "synchronous" and "asynchronous?"
* What's the difference between "blocking" and "non-blocking" behavior?
* What is Javascript for? (What was it created for?)
* Why do we care about how setTimeout and setInterval work?
* Buttons: A case study in asynchrony
* Simulating concurrent processes
* Terminology breakdown: Asynchronous, concurrent, parallel
